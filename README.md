# Churn Prediction Model for Non-Contractual Settings

This work intends to address the churn problem in non-contractual settings using machine learning techniques. The main goals are:
* Provide the risk of churn for each client
* The more relevant churn factors.  
  
The model's comprehensibility is regarded as a key factor, thus, a hybrid model using decision trees was prefered.
